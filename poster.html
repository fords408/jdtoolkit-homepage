		<p>This is a poster I have made for Journalism Design Toolkit Spring 2020. The dog pictured in the poster is my puppy, Silvy. She lives at my mother's house, and I feel so fortunate to spend this time with her at home during online classes. </p>

		<p> What I did for the assignment:

		<p> I made an appreciation poster for my puppy for this project.

			<h1>This poster includes </h1>

<ul>
  <li>A puppy</li>
  <li>A red couch</li>
  <li>A star</li>
	<li>Polka dots</li>
	<li>Happiness</li>
</ul>
