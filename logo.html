		<p>Here is the logo I made for class. I will probably make another one some day, but this was just a trial for practice.</p>

		<p> What I did for the assignment:

			<p> On Adobe Illustrator, I created a logo for a flower company of my dreams called "Fordi Flowers". Using the circle tool, I created a few circles and layered them on top of one another in a flower pattern, and used a few different shades of blue and teal to make a beauuuuutiful flower that would be the face of my fake flower shop. </p>

			<p> I also used a few fonts to make this logo — including one that only uses flowers as characters. </p>
